[Laravel Flare](https://flareapp.io/docs/integration/laravel-customizations/introduction) allows to publicly share your errors on [Flare](https://flareapp.io). If configured with a valid Flare API key, your errors in production applications will be tracked, and you'll get notified when they happen.

`spatie/laravel-flare` works for Laravel 11 and above applications running on PHP 8.2 and above. Looking for Ignition for Laravel, the most beautiful error page out there? You can still install `spatie/laravel-ignition` and admire it.

## Official Documentation

The official documentation for Flare can be found on the [Flare website](https://flareapp.io/docs/integration/laravel-customizations/introduction).
